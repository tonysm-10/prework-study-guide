# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

The study guide was made to make the process of going through the prework easier for the bootcamp students. It contains notes on the different sections we are going to learn about in the course. If you don't know what to study first, this study guide helps you choose what to study and gives you the notes for that section. I learned how to add and commit a message, pull and push my feature branch because I did it often for this project.
